# Sanctum authentication example backend

A Laravel API that uses the [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/sanctum) package to handle authentication with an SPA (see [this repo](https://github.com/unlikenesses/sanctum-react-spa) for an example).

This project is only intended to demonstrate what Sanctum can do. It is not recommended to use it as a model for your own SPA projects.
